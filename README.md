Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on getting better with coding every day, especially on the back-end because I like to build cool features.

🌱 I’m currently learning more in-depth ruby & Javascript, SQL and one front-end framework (ReactJS).

💬 Ask me about collaborating on interesting projects or jobs.

⚡ Fun fact: I already started coding back in 2011 with HTML&CSS, then switched to digital marketing / affiliate marketing shortly after. Recently I switched back to coding and successfully completed the Le Wagon Full-Stack Bootcamp in early 2021 :) In between, I still did some coding for own marketing side projects and also experimented with Python & Javascript.
