Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on getting better with coding every day, especially on the back-end because I like to build cool features.

🌱 I’m currently learning more in-depth ruby & Javascript, SQL and one front-end framework (ReactJS).

💬 Ask me about collaborating on interesting projects or jobs.

⚡ Fun fact: I already started coding back in 2011 with HTML&CSS, then switched to digital marketing / affiliate marketing shortly after only to switch back to coding by doing the Le Wagon Full-Stack Bootcamp from 01-03/2021 :) But I did some coding here and there in between for own marketing side projects, also experimented with Python & Javascript.

You can always reach out to me on LinkedIn.
